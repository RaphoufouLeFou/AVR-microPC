        <p>AVR based microcomputer outputing VGA

        The code is entirely write in Assembly for better performance from the MCU

        <li><h3>AVR-PC Specs :</h3>
            <ul>   
                <li>MCU as GPU and CPU : ATmega16A (16K ROM, 1K RAM, 0.5K EEPROM) at 16MHz</li>
                <li>One CO-CPU as IO expander and for higher storage capacity : ATmega16A (16K ROM, 1K RAM, 0.5K EEPROM) at 16MHz</li>
                <li>SRAM as VRAM : 128Kb (2x8Ko to make 16Bits colors)</li>
                <li>VGA Output : 128x64 @16bit, 60Hz</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        I was inspired a lot from Ben Eater, mainly for the VGA protcol. His website : https://eater.net/vga
