            <p>
                I'v coded some software 3D renderer in the past. The first one was written in C for my <a href="https://github.com/RaphoufouLeFou/Doom-console-ESP32">game console</a>. It was a very simple one that only drawn the edges of cubes, with single color.
                After that, I'v coded better one in C++ with SLD2. This time, it could render in real-time multiple cubes with simples texture and player mouvements.
                <br>
                Finally, I'v coded antoher one in Assembly for the AVR-MicroPC. This one was verry simple, and could draw the edges of one white cube, without any rotation or texture, but with player mouvements.
                It took aproximatly 1200 lines of <a href="https://github.com/RaphoufouLeFou/AVR-microPC/blob/main/src/Renderer8bit.asm">code</a>, but it was fast, and can run at 30FPS.
